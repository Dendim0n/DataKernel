# DataKernel

## What is DataKernel?

DataKernel is a minimalistic wrapper around CoreData stack to ease persistence operations. It is havily inspired by SugarRecord but have no external dependencies (except cocoa of course) and with some refinements. It is covered with unit tests.

If you have any propositions please file issue.
If you need usage examples - see unit test, it is very straightforward

## Features
- Swift (now tested in xCode 7.2.1, but it should work in 7.3)
- Protocols based design
- Fully tested
- Actively supported
- No carthage (but you can try and submit PR)
- No iCloud yet (but planned)

## Setup

### [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

1. Install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). You can do it with `gem install cocoapods`
2. Edit your `Podfile` file and add the following line `pod 'DataKernel'` (you have to use use_frameworks!, because this is a Swift pod)
3. Update your pods with the command `pod install`
4. Open the project from the generated workspace (`.xcworkspace` file).

*Note: You can also test the last commits by specifying it directly in the Podfile line*

### [Carthage](https://carthage)
1. Install [Carthage](https://github.com/carthage/carthage) on your computer using `brew install carthage`
3. Edit your `Cartfile` file adding the following line `github "mrdekk/DataKernel"`
4. Update and build frameworks with `carthage update`
5. Add generated frameworks to your app main target following the steps [here](https://github.com/carthage/carthage)
6. Link your target with **CoreData** library *(from Build Phases)*

#### Notes
- Carthage integration includes both, CoreData and Carthage. We're planning to separate it in multiple frameworks. [Task](https://trello.com/c/hyhN1Tp2/11-create-separated-frameworks-for-foundation-coredata-and-realm)
- SugarRecord 2.0 is not compatible with the 1.x interface. If you were using that version you'll have to update your project to support this version.

# How to use

TBD, not completed yet, see unit tests
