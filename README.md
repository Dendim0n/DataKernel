## What is DataKernel?

DataKernel is a minimalistic wrapper around CoreData stack to ease persistence operations. It is havily inspired by [SugarRecord][site-sugarrecord] but have no external dependencies (except cocoa of course) and with some refinements. It is covered with unit tests.

[site-sugarrecord]: https://github.com/pepibumur/SugarRecord

If you have any propositions please file issue.
If you need usage examples - see unit test, it is very straightforward

## Features
- Swift (tested in xCode 7.2.1, xCode 7.3.0)
- Protocols based design
- Fully tested
- Actively supported
- Rich set of operations (but I think something may be missed)
- No iCloud yet (but planned)

## Note

- context.wipe uses NSBatchDeleteRequest on iOS 9 and OSX 10.11, it gives big performance improvements, but can cause problems if you use patterns like wipe all and create new, because it acts directly on persistent store (see Apple WWDC 2015 video or slides)

## Setup

### [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

1. Install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). You can do it with `gem install cocoapods`
2. Edit your `Podfile` file and add the following line `pod 'DataKernel'` (you have to use use_frameworks!, because this is a Swift pod)
3. Update your pods with the command `pod install`
4. Open the project from the generated workspace (`.xcworkspace` file).

*Note: You can also test the last commits by specifying it directly in the Podfile line*

### [Carthage](https://carthage)
1. Install [Carthage](https://github.com/carthage/carthage) on your computer using `brew install carthage`
3. Edit your `Cartfile` file adding the following line `github "mrdekk/DataKernel"`
4. Update and build frameworks with `carthage update`
5. Add generated frameworks to your app main target following the steps [here](https://github.com/carthage/carthage)
6. Link your target with **CoreData** library *(from Build Phases)*

# How to use
